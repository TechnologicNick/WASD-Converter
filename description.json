   "description" : "[h1][b]This mod adds 4 logic gates that are powered when one of the WASD keys gets pressed.[/b][/h1]\nConnect them to a driver's seat.\n\nThe A and D only work on driver's seats with an animation, so not all modded seats will work.\n\n[b]NOTE: This only works in the test branch! (0.3.0)[/b]\n\n[b]Update 1:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] It actually works now. I forgot to add the output...\n[/list]\n\n[b]Update 2:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The WASD Converters can now be connected to controllers. When only controllers are connected, they will act like they are connected to the driver's seat. So connecting non-controller parts, you will lose some functionality.\n[*] Allowed engines to be connected to the output. You now have to use only one engine to rotate a bearing in both directions.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Update 3:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The visuals should now work for multiplayer. (Although I haven't tested this)\n[/list]\n\n[b]TODO:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] [strike]Add new parts that check camera movement.[/strike] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1428574074]>>Camera Controls<<[/url]\n[*] Make it turn on and off using a logic signal.\n[*] [strike]Check if it works with all interactable parts.[/strike]\n[*] [strike]Allow engines to be connected to the output.[/strike]\n[/list]",
